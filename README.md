# ruby_tick_tac_toe_OOP

Run the game.rb file to play using "ruby game.rb" from the console

Improvements that could be made:

The players do not have to enter their names again when they decide to play again, unless they want to

Make more naming rules, now names can be anything as long as they are not an empty string

Most methods could be shortened, for example logic behind player turns could easily be made with just one boolean instead of two
